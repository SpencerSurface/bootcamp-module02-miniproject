# OSU Coding Bootcamp Miniproject 2: CSS Snippet Cheatsheet

## Description

This project is a webpage, created to keep a selection of CSS code snippets for future reference. The point of making this page was to practice using a variety of CSS features.

Through coding this project, I got a better grasp on how to utilize features like flexboxes and media queries, and was introduced for the first time to features like transitions and linear gradients.
